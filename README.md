# Random-Number
This is a small project that I made. Basically, it can generate random number. Your task is to find a way to get the correct answer in **10 attempts!**
It will print **Lower** if your guesses higher than the random value and vice versa. If you want a hint, you can open the **"hint.md"** file. Goodluck!

# Extras
You can set the maximum value it can generate, via code. Also, **Don't set the maximum number to zero (0) or else it will throw an error.**
